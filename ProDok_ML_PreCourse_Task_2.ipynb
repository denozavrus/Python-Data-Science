    "# Task 2: Distinguishing borrowers into good and bad credit risks\n",
    "In our second task, we continue working on binary classification using  logistic regression. However, instead of synthetic toy data, we will use a real world-data set referring to risk management and decision-making in credit scoring. Compared to our first task, this classification problem is much harder to solve and requires a number of steps to get a good result. The following tasks will guide you through the process of loading, integrating, and preparing the data to eventually develop a logistic regression model. The final model predicts the probability of a credit applicant to default, meaning that the outstanding amount would not be paid back (in full). If you would like some  background information on retail credit risk assessment, have a look at our paper on[ benchmarking classification models for credit scoring](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.05.030).\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you feel that logistic regression is a rather simple model for a machine learning course, I can assure you that we will look at several more advanced learning algorithms in the course and apply some of these to the same credit scoring data you are about to use. That said, note that logistic regression is the single most important model for loan approval decisions in the industry. Familiarity with logistic regression is crucial for every data scientists and  machine learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the focus of the task is not on developing a highly accurate classifier. This will soon become our goal but first we need to do some homework: **data preparation**. Data preparation is the core of the task. The data set is challenging and you need to work hard to bring the data into a form that facilitates building classification models. In the scope of doing so, you will work intensively with Python libraries commonly used in machine learning such as Pandas. Becoming acquainted with these libraries and gaining experience in working with complex, messy real-world data is the core of the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's being with loading some of these standard libraries."

    "We are ready to start working with the data that we obtained from Kaggle. As has probably become clear already, the following tasks are nontrivial and might challenge you quite a bit. Work hard to solve them. It is definitly possible. Since the data is wel-known, you can also find much information and tips online, e.g., in the forum of the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/discussion). Shoud you nonetheless struggle with getting the data ready for analysis, using a shortcut is better than giving up. Much of the complexity of the following tasks comes from us integrating different sources of data. Getting the data ready for analysis would be a lot easier when using only the single data file *application_train.csv*. Using only this file, you could still perform many of the tasks we discuss below including handling missing values and outliers, scaling numeric variables, encoding categories, and, of course, developing a logistic regression classifier.

Importantly, the assessment involves applying the fully-specified (i.e., train**ed**) model to data that was not used before during model development (i.e., train**ing**). Another, more technical, important difference between the train and test data is that the former provides true labels for observations (i.e., a binary default / no-default indicator) whereas the latter does not. By observations we mean the rows of a DATA table, which correspond to bank clients who apply for a loan in the home credit data set.\n",

So the previous_applications file has ten entries for Eve. Merging application_train and previous_applications, we obtain ten entries for Eve in the resulting dataframe. The values for the variables (i.e., columns) of the application data re-occur over these ten rows, whereas the values in the columns belonging to the previous application data will vary. In the above sketch of the data, you can scroll to the right to verify that such a pattern exist. A first block of colums displays re-occuring values.

You should ready yourself for experiecing your notebook to crash due to out of memory errors and the like. Your will also notice that certain computations take a 'little' time to complete.

    "One idea to keep the level of frustration as low as possible. Whenever you have accomplised a task and created a new version of the data, you can store it to an h5 file. The data integration notebook has familiarized you with that operation. The benefit of storing intermediate results is that when your code crashes at some point, you can load the intermediate result (i.e., data) and re-start from there. This is easier compared to having to re-start from scratch every time."

    "Now that you have created the dataset and have a good understanding of it, it is time to prepare the data for the binary classification task. Likely, while trying to find relevant variables, you already noticed some issues with the data. In this sub-task, we will deal with those issues. First of all, we store the target variable of the train dataset in a separate dataframe and delete it from the train dataset. This allows us to combine the train and test dataframes, which, in turn, is useful because we want to apply operations such as imputing missing values or scaling the values of a variable to the training and the test data.

    "Information is often stored as a numerical variable. The variables you processed above are an example. The age of an applicant is a numerical variable. Likewise, a credit score, an applicant's income, the amount of a loan, etc. are numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the scale of numerical variables varies substantially. A variable may also exhibit extreme values (i.e., outliers), which can cause problems. In this sub-task, you have to make choices concerning handling potential outliers.\n",
    "Try to find all numerical variables and apply outlier detection. Box-Plots are always a helpful tool to check for outliers, however there might be other (more automatic) strategies to handle outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition what value constitutes an outlier is somewhat subjective. Make a sensible decision and replace outliers by a missing-value."

    "\n",
    "With larger datasets, it is common to run into memory issues. Recent versions of Pandas (i.e., Pandas 1.x) are maybe are bit more robust but in general, it is good practice to pay attention to memory consumption. An easy way to free up memory is to convert binary variables, also called FLAG variables, to a small integer type and to reduce the float size of the other numeric variables. \n",

    "### Categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important type of variables are categorical variables. These are variables that  do not have an explicit numeric meaning but represent different categories or classes. An example for a categorical variable could be the occupation of a person (e.g. Student, Factory-worker, Accountant...). Each category level provides information about a person but you cannot transfer the different occupations into a numeric space. Some algorithm implementations have built-in functions to deal with categories. Typically, however, this is your job. In this sub-task, we will use one-hot encoding (also referenced as dummy encoding) where every class becomes a binary variable. For more information read e.g. [this post](https://towardsdatascience.com/one-hot-encoding-multicollinearity-and-the-dummy-variable-trap-b5840be3c41a).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the actual coding operations, however, we need to attend to one issue in our data. You have probably not noticed it but three variables have changed their data type from category to object when we combined the training and test data. Feel free to diagnose why his happend if you are interested. It has to do with different category levels in the training and test set. Without going into details, we want to convert the affected variables back to data type categorical. So determine which variables are stored as data type object, verify that these variables are indeed categorical variabels and convert them to data type category before moving on. "

For example, if you have a categorical variable with three levels: red, green, blue you need only 3-1=2 two dummy variables to encode the information of the category as, e.g., isRed {0,1}, isGreen {0,1}. If both dummies are equal to zero, this implies that the category level of the observation before dummy coding was blue. In other words, you do not need a third dummy variable isBlue {0,1} to encode the category. Using n-1 dummy variables, with n denoting the number of category levels, is called reference coding."

    "Logistic regression has the nice benefit of giving us information how \"important\" a variable is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the top ten most important variables. Do the variables which you identified in the EDA show up? If you find variables in the list, you haven't looked at in the EDA, consider going back to the EDA task to plot them to get an intuition on why they might be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** If you have used the statsmodel library for your logit model, the above task should be easy. If you developed the logit model using scikit-learn, you cannot easily get p-values for regression coefficients. See [this post for some details and remedies](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/15398/how-to-get-p-value-and-confident-interval-in-logisticregression-with-sklearn). A crude but workable solution for scikit-learn users is to select important variables by looking at the magnitude of the estimated coefficients. Provided you did scale your data, which we did before, coefficient magnitudes signal variable importance. We will discuss more powerful and versatile ways to determine variable importance in the course."
